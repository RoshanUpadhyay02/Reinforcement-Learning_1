# Reinforcement Learning


This repository provides a collection of reinforcement learning examples showcasing various fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field. The examples included in this repository cover a range of tasks and problems, including the K-Bandit Problem, Navigation Task, Policy Evaluation Comparison, Policy Iteration and Evaluation, and Tic-Tac-Toe.

The K-Bandit Problem demonstrates the exploration-exploitation trade-off, where an agent must decide between exploring unexplored actions and exploiting actions that have yielded high rewards in the past. The code in this example showcases different strategies for solving the K-Bandit Problem and compares their performance.

The Navigation Task example focuses on an agent learning to navigate in a grid-like environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms are employed to train the agent to reach a goal state while avoiding obstacles. The code in this example provides an implementation of the navigation task using popular reinforcement learning techniques.

Policy Evaluation Comparison explores different approaches to policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. It presents various algorithms and compares their effectiveness in estimating the value function of a given policy. The code in this example can be used to experiment with different policy evaluation algorithms and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Policy Iteration and Evaluation demonstrates the process of improving a policy iteratively through policy evaluation and policy improvement steps. The code in this example showcases how to perform policy iteration and evaluation on a given task, helping users understand the iterative nature of reinforcement learning algorithms.

Lastly, the Tic-Tac-Toe example showcases the application of reinforcement learning in solving the classic game. It demonstrates how an agent can learn to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally through self-play and reinforcement learning techniques. The code in this example provides an implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe environment and a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the game.
